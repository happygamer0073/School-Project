        <section class="game_main">
            <div class="game">Need for Speed (NFS) is a racing video game franchise published by Electronic Arts and currently developed by Criterion Games.
            The series generally centers around illicit street racing and tasks players to complete various types of races while evading the local law enforcement in police pursuits.
            The series is one of EA's oldest franchises. The franchise has been critically well-received and is one of the most successful video game franchises of all time, selling over 150 million copies of games.
            Almost all of the games in the NFS series employ the same fundamental rules and similar mechanics: the player controls a race car in a variety of races, the goal being to win the race.
            In the tournament/career mode, the player must win a series of races in order to unlock vehicles and tracks.
            Before each race, the player chooses a vehicle and has the option of selecting either an automatic or manual transmission.
            All games in the series have some form of multiplayer mode allowing players to race one another via a split screen, a LAN or the Internet.

            Founded in May 1982 by Apple employee Trip Hawkins, the company was a pioneer of the early home computer game industry and promoted the designers and programmers responsible for its games as "software artists."
