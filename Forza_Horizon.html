            <div class="game">Forza Horizon is a 2012 racing video game developed by Playground Games and published by Microsoft Studios for the Xbox 360 on 23 October 2012.
            The game is the fifth instalment of the Forza series, having originally spun-off from Turn 10 Studios' Forza Motorsport series.
            Taking place during the fictitious Horizon Festival, a street racing event set in the state of Colorado, the aim is to progress via winning races, while also increasing the popularity level by performing stunts.
            Players can drive off-road in select areas while others are limited by guardrails or other means.
            Forza Horizon was released to critical acclaim and has since spawned its own series, with four additional sequels to date: Forza Horizon 2 in 2014, Forza Horizon 3 in 2016, Forza Horizon 4 in 2018, and Forza Horizon 5 in 2021.

            <div class="ForzaMotorsports">Forza Motorsport is a simulation racing video game.
            Players compete in events around the globe using real licensed cars on a variety of real world and fictional courses.
            It features an arcade mode, meant more for quickplay of races, and a career mode, which is focused on long-term play.
            Career mode spans several racing disciplines, spanning from racing of common commuter cars to those in racing series such as Super GT and Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters as well as other sports car racing series.
            To help players acclimate to the simulation style of racing, assists such as an ideal racing line, anti-lock brakes and traction control can be used.
            There are 231 cars in Forza Motorsport ranging from a Honda Civic to supercars such as the Enzo Ferrari and Le Mans race prototypes such as the Audi R8.
            There are nine classes of cars, spanning standard production vehicles to sports and high performance cars to purpose-built race cars.
            Each car can be upgraded and tuned with a large number of extras and parts.
