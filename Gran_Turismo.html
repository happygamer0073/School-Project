            <div class="game">Gran Turismo (GT) is a series of racing simulation video games developed by Polyphony Digital.
                Developed for PlayStation systems, Gran Turismo games are intended to emulate the appearance and performance of a large selection of vehicles, most of which are licensed reproductions of real-world automobiles.
                Since the franchise's debut in 1997, over 85 million units have been sold worldwide for the PlayStation, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation Portable, making it the highest selling video game franchise under the PlayStation brand.
                The appeal of the Gran Turismo series is due significantly to its graphics, a large number of licensed vehicles, attention to vehicle detail, accurate driving physics emulation, and the ability to tune performance, hence the subtitle "The Real Driving Simulator", incorporated to the franchise's iconography since Gran Turismo 4.
                Handling of the vehicles is modeled on real-life driving impressions, tuning is based on principles of physics, and the sound of the vehicle's engine is based on recordings of the actual vehicles.
